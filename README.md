Welcome to the contact management system! 
In the menu, you will see several options for your contact list. You can add contacts by providing a first and last name, phone number, and email.
After that, your contact will be saved to a file that you can use later. In the edit contacts function, you will have to enter the name of the contact exactly how you spelled it since 
it is case sensitive. After that, you can modify your phone number and email.
The menu also allows you to delete, search and display your contacts.
And if you want to send them to a different file, export it and name that exported file.
Once you're finished, the program will exit and tell you 'Goodbye!'.
